# Cloud Foundry Route Lookup Plugin

This is a Cloud Foundry CLI plugin to quickly identify applications, a given route is pointing to.
Note this will only show applications in organizations and spaces, that the logged-in user has permissions to view.

## Installation

Run

```
cf install-plugin -r CF-Community cf-lookup-route
```
    
Alternatively:

1. Download the appropriate binary from [the Releases page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-lookup-route/releases).
2. Run

    ```
    cf install-plugin PATH_TO_ROUTE_LOOKUP_BINARY
    ```

## Usage

EXAMPLES:

```
$ cf lookup-route https://my.example.com
Bound to:
Organization: <org> (<org_guid>)
Space       : <space> (<space_guid>)
App         : <app1> (<app_guid_1>)
App         : <app2> (<app_guid_2>)

To target this org/space, run:
  cf target -o <org> -s <space>
 
# if no protocol is specified, https is assumed by default,
# so the following yields the same result as above:
$ cf lookup-route my.example.com
Bound to:
Organization: <org> (<org_guid>)
Space       : <space> (<space_guid>)
App         : <app1> (<app_guid_1>)
App         : <app2> (<app_guid_2>)

To target this org/space, run:
  cf target -o <org> -s <space>


$ cf lookup-route unknown.example.com
Error retrieving apps: Route <unknown.example.com> not found.
```
## Uninstallation
